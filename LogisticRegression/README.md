## Logistic Regression Classifier
This Python class implements a logistic regression classifier. Logistic regression is a popular machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks.

##### Installation

You can install the LogisticRegression class by cloning this repository or by directly copying the LogisticRegression class into your project.
##### Methods
- Fit the logistic regression model to the training data with optional early stopping and loss plotting.
  ```python
  fit(X_train, y_train, X_val=None, y_val=None, patience=None, print_loss=True, plot_loss=True):
  ```
- Predict class labels for test data.
  ```python
  predict(X_test):
  ```
##### Usage
```python
from logistic_regression import LogisticRegression
import numpy as np

# Create an instance of the LogisticRegression class
model = LogisticRegression()

# Fit the model to your training data
X_train = np.array([...])  # Your training features
y_train = np.array([...])  # Your training labels
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict labels for new data
X_test = np.array([...])  # Your test features
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

```
##### Dependencies
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for plotting loss)
